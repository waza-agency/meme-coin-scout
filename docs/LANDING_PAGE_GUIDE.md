## Design System Integration

### Colors Used (from tailwind.config.js)
- `crypto-dark`: #0a0a0a (main background)
- `crypto-gray`: #1a1a1a (card backgrounds)
- `crypto-light-gray`: #2a2a2a (borders)

### Animations
- Fade-in: opacity + translate-y transitions
- Scale transforms on hover (1.05x for buttons)
- Pulse effects for attention
- Bounce animation for scroll indicator
- Smooth color transitions (300ms duration)

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Grid layouts that adapt: 1 col (mobile) → 2 col (md) → 3 col (lg)
- Text sizes scale: base → md → lg
- Spacing adjusts for screen size
- Touch-friendly button sizes on mobile

## User Flow

1. **Initial Load**: User sees landing page with staggered animations
2. **Scroll Down**: Features section appears, cards can be hovered
3. **Continue Scroll**: CTA section animates into view
4. **Click CTA**: Transitions to main app interface
5. **In App**: "Back to Home" button appears top-left
6. **Return**: Clicking back button shows landing page again

## Accessibility Features

- Semantic HTML structure
- Keyboard navigation support
- Touch-friendly tap targets (min 44px)
- Sufficient color contrast ratios
- Smooth scroll behavior for "Learn More" button
- Clear visual focus states on interactive elements

## Performance Optimizations

- CSS transitions instead of JavaScript animations where possible
- Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered animations (only animates when visible)
- No external image dependencies
- Efficient re-renders with proper React hooks
- Cleanup of intervals and observers on unmount

## Internationalization Ready

The component structure supports easy internationalization:
- All text is in component props/constants (can be extracted to i18n files)
- No hard-coded strings in JSX where dynamic content needed
- Flexible layouts that adapt to different text lengths

## Customization Guide

### Changing Colors
Edit gradients in component files:
```tsx
// Example in HeroSection.tsx
className="bg-gradient-to-r from-crypto-accent to-crypto-blue"
```

### Adjusting Animations
Modify transition classes:
```tsx
// Example duration change
className="transition-all duration-300" // 300ms
className="transition-all duration-700" // 700ms
```

### Adding Features
Add new items to the `features` array in `FeaturesSection.tsx`:
```tsx
{
  icon: YourIcon,
  title: 'New Feature',
  description: 'Description here',
  gradient: 'from-color to-color',
}
```

### Updating Stats
Modify the stats array in `HeroSection.tsx`:
```tsx
{ label: 'Your Stat', value: 'Value' }
```

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- CSS Grid and Flexbox support required
- CSS custom properties (CSS variables) support
- Intersection Observer API (polyfill available if needed)
